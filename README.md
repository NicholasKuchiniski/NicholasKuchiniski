### Nicholas Kuchiniski

Hi there :smiley:, I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I work with software development since 2017, mainly with Javascript and its technologies like NodeJS and ReactJS. I like to learn in practice and with things I use in my day to day and that's why I use Github to keep my personal study projects that can be seen in my profile.
